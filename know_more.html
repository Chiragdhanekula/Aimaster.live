     Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers
     and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, 
     decision making, creativity and autonomy.Applications and devices equipped
     with AI can see and identify objects. They can understand and respond to 
     human language. They can learn from new information and experience. 
     They can make detailed recommendations to users and experts. They can act 
     independently, replacing the need for human intelligence or 
     intervention (a classic example being a self-driving car).</p>
